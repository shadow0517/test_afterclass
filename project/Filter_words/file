Although we have learned English for several years, and we have some knowledge about the English-speaking countries, there are still many people can not distinguish the relationships between England, Britain and United Kingdom. UK is the short form of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, or commonly known as Britain. UK is composed of four parts. They are: England, Scotland, Welsh and Northern Ireland. London is the capital of UK. UK is a constitutional monarchy, and the head of state is a king or a queen. The United Kingdom is governed, in the name of the Sovereign by His or Her Majesty's Government.
