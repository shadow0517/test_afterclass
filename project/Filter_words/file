Hello i am from CHina and i love my country. If i can choose, i will certainly live in this land. 
st week, I lost my umbrella when I got off the bus. I felt so sorry for being so careless. My friend told me that I could go to the terminal station to look for my umbrella. So I did as they told me. When I got there and asked the officers, they showed me the losing stuffs and I found my umbrella! What a surprise.
